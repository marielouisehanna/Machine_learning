# Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’°

## Project Overview
This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based deep learning model for predicting car prices. It preprocesses data, trains models, and evaluates performance using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding)
- Building and training deep learning models
- Model evaluation using MAE and RÂ² score
- Visualizing predictions and training history
- Saving and loading trained model weights
