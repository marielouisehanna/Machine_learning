# Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project is all about classifying flowers using machine learning. It takes in images of flowers and predicts their types using a trained model.

## How It Works
- The notebook loads and processes flower images.
- A deep learning model is trained to recognize different flower species.
- The model is evaluated and tested to ensure accuracy.

## Requirements
Make sure you have these installed before running the notebook:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install missing dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## How to Run
1. Open the `FlowersClassification.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells step by step.
3. Upload your own flower images to test the model.

## Results
The model will predict the type of flower based on the image input and show the classification results.
