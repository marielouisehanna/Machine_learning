# Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project is a deep learning model designed to classify different types of flowers from images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize and categorize flowers based on their visual features.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses flower images automatically.
- Trains a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluates model performance and provides accuracy metrics.
- Accepts new images for real-time classification.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset consists of various flower species images.
- Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) for better accuracy.
- Augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.

## Installation
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Open `FlowersClassification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
3. Upload a new image to see the classification results.

## Model Details
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers.
- Includes dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Trained on labeled flower images for better accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Displays classification accuracy and loss graphs.
- Provides predictions for new images with confidence scores.
